# Introduction

Welcome to this dedicated repository for our Machine Learning project, focusing on Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
My primary objective is to explore and implement advanced CNN architectures, comparing their performance on a common dataset.

Update: I performed hyperparameter tuning using the Keras high-level tuner. Due to the computation constraints I used 256 and 128 batch size of prefetched Keras data import function.
